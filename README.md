# Auto-APA-Citation-
Using python to take reference links from a word file and then inputing them into a citation website, followed by pasting the final references back into the word file.

This is a simple program that uses pyautogui to automate the citation process. The website used to generate the citation is the 'citation machine' which is free however, ads do play and the its accuracy is not very high. Better websites can be used but the idea is still the same. To run the program, all you need to do is put all the reference links in a word file and open this word file when you run the program.
